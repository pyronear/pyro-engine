# Contributing to pyroengine

Everything you need to know to contribute efficiently to the project.



## Codebase structure

- [pyroengine](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-engine/blob/master/pyroengine) - The actual pyroengine library


## Continuous Integration

This project uses the following integrations to ensure proper codebase maintenance:

- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) - run jobs for package build and coverage
- [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) - analyzes commits for code quality
- [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) - reports back coverage results

As a contributor, you will only have to ensure coverage of your code by adding appropriate unit testing of your code.



## Issues

Use Github [issues](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-engine/issues) for feature requests, or bug reporting. When doing so, use issue templates whenever possible and provide enough information for other contributors to jump in.



## Code contribution

In order to contribute to  project, we will first **set up the development environment**, then describe the **contributing workflow**.

### Project Setup
---
In order to enable every one to fluently contribute to the project, we are going
to set up the project properly following some steps:
1. **Create a virtual environment** to avoid collision with our OS and other projects
2. **Fork the project** to be able to start working on a local copy of the project

#### 1. Create a virtual environment
We are going to create an python3.6 environment with dedicated to Pyro project. We'll use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/).

Please open a terminal and follow the instructions.
```shell
# install package
pip install virtualenvwrapper

# add at the end of your .bashrc
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=$(which python3)
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

# list available virtual environments
workon

# create new environment dubbed "pyro36" using python 3.6
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3.6) pyro36

# activate pyro36 environment
workon pyro36

# deactivate the current environment
deactivate

# delete virtual environment (only do it if needed)
rmvirtualenv pyro36
```

#### 2. Fork the repository
We are going to get a local copy of the remote project (_fork_) and set remotes so we stay up to date to recent contributions.

1. Create a fork by clicking on the **fork button** on the current repository page
2. Clone _your_ fork locally.
```shell
# change directory to one for the project
cd /path/to/local/pyronear/project/

# clone your fork. replace YOUR_USERNAME accordingly
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pyro-engine.git

# cd to pyro-engine
cd pyro-engine
```

3. Set remotes to original project and merge new contributions onto master.
```shell
# add the original repository as remote repository called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-engine.git

# verify repository has been correctly added
git remote -v

# fetch all changes from the upstream repository
git fetch upstream

# switch to the master branch of your fork
git checkout master

# merge changes from the upstream repository into your fork
git merge upstream/master
```

4. install the project dependencies
```shell
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install current project in editable mode,
# so local changes will be reflected locally (ie:at import)
pip install -e .
```



### Contributing workflow
---
Once the project is well set up, we are going to detail step by step a usual contributing workflow.

1.  Merge recent contributions onto master (do this frequently to stay up-to-date)
```shell
# fetch all changes from the upstream repository
git fetch upstream

# switch to the master branch of your fork
git checkout master

# merge changes from the upstream repository into your fork
git merge upstream/master
```

Note: Since, we are going to create features on separate local branches so they'll be merged onto **original project remote master** via pull requests, we may use **pulling** instead of fetching & merging. This way our **_local_ master branch** will reflect **_remote_ original project**. We don't expect to make changes on local master in this workflow so no conflict should arise when merging:
```shell
# switch to local master
git checkout master

#  merge remote master of original project onto local master
git pull upstream/master
```

2. Create a local feature branch to work on

```shell
# Create a new branch with the name of your feature
git checkout -b pioneering-feature-branch
```

3. Commit your changes (remember to add unit tests for your code). Feel free to interactively rebase your history to improve readability. See [Commits section](#commits) to follow guidelines.

4. Rebase your feature branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward that won't require any conflict resolution work.
```shell
# Switch to feature branch
git checkout pioneering-feature-branch

# Rebase on master
git rebase master
```

5. Push your changes on remote feature branch.
```shell
git checkout pioneering-feature-branch

# Push first time (we create remote branch at the same time)
git push -u origin pioneering-feature-branch

# Next times, we simply push commits
git push origin
```

6. When satisfied with your branch, open a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork in order to integrate your contribution to original project.

### Commits

- **Code**: ensure to provide docstrings to your Python code. In doing so, please follow [Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) so it can ease the process of documentation later.
- **Commit message**: please follow [Udacity guide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)
