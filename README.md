# pyroengine: Deploy Pyronear wildfire detection

The increasing adoption of mobile phones have significantly shortened the time required for firefighting agents to be alerted of a starting wildfire. In less dense areas, limiting and minimizing this duration remains critical to preserve forest areas.

![pyrovision](https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-vision) aims at providing the means to create a wildfire early detection system with state-of-the-art performances at minimal deployment costs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 (or more recent)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

You can install the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyronear/) as follows:

```shell
pip install pyroengine
```
### Environment files 

The `pyroengine/pi_utils/python.env` file must contain:
- `WEBSERVER_IP`: the IP address of the main rpi once it is installed on site
- `WEBSERVER_PORT`: the port exposed on the main rpi for the local webserver

### Test Engine

You can test to run a prediction using our Pyronear Engine using the following:

```shell
from pyroengine.engine import PyronearEngine
from PIL import Image

engine = PyronearEngine()

im = Image.open("path/to/your/image.jpg").convert('RGB')

prediction = engine.predict(image) 
```

This is a quick demo without api setup, so without sending the alert
